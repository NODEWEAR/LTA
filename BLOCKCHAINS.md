Songbird Network
- **Role**: Serves as an experimental or "canary" network for the Flare Network, similar to the relationship between Kusama and Polkadot.
- **Native Token**: Songbird's native token is SGB, used to incentivize network participation.
- **Testing**: Provides a real-world environment for developers to test new features, applications, and smart contracts.
- **User Benefits**: Allows early access to innovative features and the opportunity to participate in network governance through SGB.
- **Goal**: Enhances the stability and functionality of the Flare Network by enabling rigorous testing and community engagement.

Flare Network
- **Role**: Aims to bring smart contract capabilities to digital assets that lack native support, like XRP, Litecoin, and Dogecoin.
- **Native Token**: The native token is the Flare Token (FLR), used for governance and as a utility token.
- **Interoperability**: Utilizes a modified version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine for compatibility with Ethereum-based tools and dApps.
- **DeFi**: Enables decentralized finance activities like staking, liquidity provision, and yield farming using FLR and other assets.
- **Governance**: FLR token holders often have voting rights on network upgrades and other governance issues.
- **Goal**: To create a robust, interoperable, and community-driven blockchain network.

Both networks aim to work in tandem to improve the scalability, security, and overall functionality of the blockchain space they operate in.
SGB is utilzed as the test enviroment for NODEWEAR. FLR is utilzed for final interations and premium releases.
